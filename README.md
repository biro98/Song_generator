# Song_generator
This is a fun project that use Taylor Swift lysics to train a LSTM and to then generate automatically Taylor Swift lyrics.

The Datasets used were taken from Kaggle:

The project is inspired to a existent project on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/super13579/let-s-auto-write-the-deep-purple-lysics-pytorch

Some sentence are not too meaningful, but the model predicts the word correctly. Perhaphs more time should be invested in investigating different model setup (hyperparametrs) or different type o network.
